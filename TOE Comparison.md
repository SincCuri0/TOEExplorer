| **Materialism / Physicalism** <br>(*matter is fundamental*) | **Low.** Assumes physical entities/laws without further reason; leaves the existence of matter and its specific laws as brute givens (fails to answer *“Why is there something rather than nothing?”*) ([Two Perspectives onThomas Nagel’s Mind and Cosmos – The Threepenny Review](https://www.threepennyreview.com/two-perspectives-onthomas-nagels-mind-and-cosmos/#:~:text=that%20%E2%80%9Cmaterialism%E2%80%9D%20is%20simply%20not,Of%20course)). | **Medium.** Takes physics as *given* (the world just *is* physical), so it describes physical phenomena but doesn’t *derive* why the laws are what they are. | **Low.** Tends to treat math as a human descriptive tool, not explaining why abstract mathematical truths exist or correspond to reality. | **Highly Rational.** Emphasizes logical-empirical rigor and scientific reasoning; avoids mysticism or unverifiable assertions. | **High.** Forms the basis of testable science – all claims are in principle empirically checkable under physicalist assumptions. | **High.** Conceptually simple ontology (only matter); no inherent contradictions, though it struggles with explaining mind and abstract entities (a *completeness* issue rather than formal inconsistency) ([Two Perspectives onThomas Nagel’s Mind and Cosmos – The Threepenny Review](https://www.threepennyreview.com/two-perspectives-onthomas-nagels-mind-and-cosmos/#:~:text=that%20%E2%80%9Cmaterialism%E2%80%9D%20is%20simply%20not,Of%20course)). | **Low.** Separates mental phenomena as mere by-products; does not unify mind with matter (the “hard problem” of consciousness remains). | **Low.** Provides shallow answers for ultimate questions (e.g. treats life and mind as accidental products ([Two Perspectives onThomas Nagel’s Mind and Cosmos – The Threepenny Review](https://www.threepennyreview.com/two-perspectives-onthomas-nagels-mind-and-cosmos/#:~:text=that%20%E2%80%9Cmaterialism%E2%80%9D%20is%20simply%20not,Of%20course))), offering no deeper reason *why* reality exists as it does. | **High.** Very parsimonious ontology (only one kind of substance); prefers no entities beyond the physical. | **Low.** Does not posit any necessary being or principle – everything could, in principle, have been otherwise or not existed at all (many physicalists accept brute contingency). |
| **Cartesian Dualism** <br>(*mind and matter as separate substances*) | **Low.** Leaves two fundamental substances unexplained (why there are both mind *and* matter); often relies on a deus ex machina (e.g. God) to bridge explanatory gaps (e.g. to synchronize mind and body). | **Low.** Takes matter and its laws as a given (like materialism does) – physics is not derived from first principles, just assumed as the realm of body. | **Low.** No special account of math beyond perhaps existing in the mind or in God’s intellect; doesn’t elucidate why mathematics so effectively describes the material world. | **Rationalist (for its era).** Descartes used logical arguments and clear distinctions, but the interaction issue introduced a somewhat ad hoc element (the “pineal gland” or divine coordination) that weakens its strict rationality. | **Low.** Lacks testable claims – an immaterial mind can’t be directly observed. (Interactions were posited but not empirically confirmed; modern science finds no clear evidence of non-physical causes in the brain.) | **Medium.** Conceptually **inconsistent** without add-ons: how can mind (non-spatial) move matter (spatial)? The classic **interaction problem** shows internal tension – some dualists invoked God’s intervention to make mind-body interaction work ([Dualism and Mind - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/dualism-and-mind/#:~:text=Two%20other%20forms%20of%20substance,happenings%20to%20create%20appropriate%20experiences)). | **Low.** Splits reality into two domains without a higher unity; mind and matter remain fundamentally divided. (It solves none of the fragmentation – it *creates* it.) | **Medium.** Identifies that neither matter nor mind alone suffices (giving some depth to the mind-body problem), but doesn’t answer why the whole setup exists. Ultimate cause is often deferred to God (outside the theory’s two-substance framework). | **Low.** Less simple than monism – posits two ontological primitives. It adds complexity (two kinds of stuff) with no deeper explanatory payoff. | **Low.** Does not argue that mind or matter *must* exist; they just do. (If God is included, God is necessary, but that’s outside pure Cartesian dualism itself.) |
| **Platonism** (classical **Theory of Forms** or **Mathematical Realism**) | **Medium.** Eternal Forms exist without cause (they just are). The physical world is often seen as contingent or a copy shaped by Forms (requiring, e.g. Plato’s Demiurge to explain its instantiation). So while Forms themselves are necessary in this view, the theory doesn’t fully explain why the material instantiation occurs. | **Low.** Physics isn’t derived; the physical world “participates” in Forms, but Plato’s theory doesn’t give physical laws – it explains *patterns* (e.g. why circles exist: imitation of the Form of Circle) but not quantitative laws of nature. | **High.** Abstract mathematical objects and universals are *the* fundamental reality ([The Universe Is Made Of Mathematics - Issue 113 - Philosophy Now](https://philosophynow.org/issues/113/The_Universe_Is_Made_Of_Mathematics#:~:text=The%20Mathematical%20Universe%20Hypothesis%20has,In%20his%20own%20words%2C%20%E2%80%9Cthere)). Platonism inherently accounts for math’s existence (numbers, geometries exist as Forms) – mathematics is *ontologically real* in this view, not just invention. | **Rationalist/Mystical mix.** Rational in that it postulates a knowable intelligible realm of Forms accessible via reason, but “mystical” in treating these Forms as transcendent entities grasped by a kind of intellectual insight (beyond empirical proof). | **Low.** Not empirically testable – one cannot physically detect the realm of Forms. Its appeals are more to intuition and logical necessity than experiment. | **Medium.** Internally coherent as a two-tier ontology (Forms vs. sensibles), but faces the “Third Man” problem (regress in explaining the link between Forms and particulars). It’s a *structured* system, but the relationship between the eternal and temporal introduces philosophical puzzles rather than contradictions per se. | **Medium.** Unifies **particulars** under universal Forms (all red things unite under “Redness,” etc.), giving a common explanatory ground for categories. However, it **splits reality** into a dual realm (intelligible vs sensible) without a single underlying substance. | **Medium.** Deeper than materialism in that it says everyday things are shadows of deeper reality (providing an answer to why things have the properties they do — because of eternal Forms). But it leaves the question “Why do the Forms themselves exist?” unanswered (they’re typically just assumed to exist necessarily). | **Low.** Posits two layers of reality and innumerable Forms — a heavy ontological commitment. (Later Neoplatonists tried to simplify by deriving all Forms from a single One, but classical Platonism itself has a multiplicity of fundamental entities.) | **Medium.** Platonic Forms are usually considered necessary (they *must* exist and could not be otherwise, providing an eternal blueprint for any possible world). However, the physical world is not seen as necessary in Plato’s account (it’s a “secondary” reality). |
| **Aristotelian–Thomistic Metaphysics** <br>(*hylomorphism, first cause*) | **High.** Seeks to avoid brute contingencies via the **Principle of Sufficient Reason** and a hierarchy of causes. Every contingent being is explained by a series of causes culminating in a **necessary prime mover** (or necessary being) that itself requires no external explanation. Nothing is left utterly unaccounted for – the buck stops with a self-explaining fundamental (often identified as God). | **Medium.** Provides a *philosophical* grounding for physics: e.g. matter has **forms** and **final causes** that explain why it behaves lawfully. (Modern Thomists interpret physical laws as rooted in natures/essences.) However, it doesn’t predict specific scientific laws – it complements physics by saying *why* a lawful order exists (because of sustaining divine order or intrinsic teleology). | **Medium.** Mathematics is seen as the abstraction of the quantitative aspects of things (forms abstracted by the intellect). Thomistic views often hold math truths reside in the mind of God or as logical necessities. It explains reliability of math (God’s creation is ordered) but doesn’t uniquely derive math from first principles. | **Highly Rational.** Uses rigorous logical argumentation (e.g. Aristotelian syllogisms, Aquinas’s **Five Ways**). It is systematic and analytical, though some aspects (like teleology or divine attributes) go beyond strictly empirical observation. | **Low.** Not directly testable by experiments – it’s a meta-framework. It aligns with empirical facts (e.g. causality, motion) but its key entities (substantial forms, prime mover) aren’t subject to laboratory verification. | **High.** Internally consistent if one accepts the starting axioms (act/potency, non-contradiction, etc.). Centuries of refinement have made the system logically coherent. (Apparent paradoxes like “motionless mover” are explained in terms of different categories of being.) | **High.** Great unifying power: integrates **form and matter**, **essence and existence**, physics and metaphysics into one hierarchy. Everything from stones to minds is composed of form/matter (or act/potency) and is directed ultimately by one highest cause, tying all levels of reality together. | **High.** Addresses fundamental “Why” questions: e.g. *Why does anything exist?* – because a necessary being imparts existence; *Why do things have order?* – because of inherent forms and a divine intellect. It doesn’t settle for “that’s just how it is” – it posits deep reasons (though those reasons ultimately rest in the nature of the first cause/God). | **Medium.** Uses a **few** key principles (causality, act/potency) but also a layered ontology (multiple causes, categories, etc.). It’s more complex than pure materialism, but proponents argue it’s as complex as reality needs – and no more. (Ockham’s razor is applied within reason, but not at the cost of explanatory adequacy.) | **High.** Central to its framework is a metaphysically necessary foundation (an uncaused cause that *must* exist and cannot not exist, to ground all contingent existence). Many classical arguments insist the existence of such a necessary being is logically inescapable (Source provided). (Contingent reality alone is insufficient; a self-existent source is required.) |
| **Berkeleyan Idealism** <br>(*subjective idealism – reality as ideas in minds*) | **Medium.** Eliminates matter as an independent brute fact (all “material” things are ideas), but then everything rests on God’s will. Berkeley reduces contingency by saying the stable order of the world is upheld by a necessary infinite Mind (God), yet he doesn’t **explain** why God and finite spirits exist – they’re taken as given. | **Medium.** Explains why physics *works* (why objects follow laws): those laws are simply regularities in the ideas that God instills in our minds (the “language” by which God communicates phenomena). Physical forces are no more than the consistent habits of the divine mind. However, it doesn’t derive specific equations – it just says the empirical regularities reflect God’s ordering. | **Low.** Mathematics, for Berkeley, is a product of minds; he was even skeptical of abstract general ideas. Math truths hold insofar as God ensures a coherent experience, but Berkeley offers no independent grounding for mathematics’ necessity – math is useful and true as far as our ideas of quantity go, but it’s not a fundamental substance in his ontology (which contains only minds and ideas). | **Rationalist.** He used rigorous philosophical arguments (e.g. the impossibility of conceiving matter independent of perception) to arrive at idealism. Yet his vision has a certain elegance (“the world is God’s language”) that goes beyond dry logic, approaching a poetic image of reality sustained by a supreme spirit. | **Low.** Empirically, it makes no prediction differing from materialism – it simply reinterprets observations. (There is no experiment to distinguish “matter exists” from “only ideas exist, sustained by God” – both scenarios yield the same experiences.) | **High.** Internally, it’s consistent: by positing that an all-powerful Spirit orchestrates perceptions, Berkeley avoided contradictions in his system. (He deftly preempted the “if a tree falls with no one around” issue by asserting an ever-present divine observer.) Some find it counterintuitive, but it doesn’t suffer logical incoherence given its premises. | **Medium.** It unifies reality under one category (**mental** being). Everything is either a mind or an idea within mind. This elegantly solves mind-body dualism (there is no matter to conflict with mind). However, it introduces a different bifurcation: infinite Mind vs. finite minds (and their ideas) – though of the same substance (spirit), they are very unequal in status. | **High.** Provides a deep answer to what a physical object *is* (an idea in a mind) and why a stable reality persists (the continual perception by God). It tackles the age-old skepticism about the external world by effectively saying the “external world” *is mental* and thus directly accessible in consciousness. The “why exists?” ultimately is answered with “because God wills it” – a traditional but metaphysically complete answer within that framework. | **Medium.** In one sense, it’s extremely simple (no matter, just minds and ideas). However, it invokes God as a central component, which some might count as an “extraneous” assumption if one is judging by parsimony alone. (Berkeley would argue God is a necessary assumption to avoid chaos and solipsism, not an optional add-on.) | **Medium.** God in Berkeley’s system is a necessary being to sustain reality (so reality’s order is necessarily upheld), but Berkeley doesn’t argue that God *had* to create this world. Finite minds and their experiences are contingent on God’s will. So the framework has a necessary core (God/mind), but the particular “story” of our world is contingent. |
| **Spinoza’s Monism** <br>(*one infinite substance: “God or Nature”*) | **High.** Absolutely no contingencies in principle: there is only one Substance that exists **necessarily** and everything else (finite things, minds, bodies) are just modes (manifestations) of that single self-caused reality. Nothing is unexplained outside the one Substance – *it* is its own reason for being. | **Medium.** Spinoza’s single substance has an attribute of **Extension** (the physical aspect). In principle, all physical law and phenomena are just the one substance behaving in a lawful, determined way. Spinoza doesn’t derive Newton’s laws or such, but he claims whatever physics turns out to be, it’s one aspect of God/Nature’s essence. (The existence of an orderly nature is guaranteed, but detailed physics wasn’t Spinoza’s focus.) | **Medium.** Another attribute of the one substance is **Thought**, which would contain all truths, including mathematical truths, as modes of God’s infinite intellect. Spinoza would say mathematical truths are eternally true ideas in the mind of God (the single substance). He didn’t develop a separate mathematical metaphysics, but in his system, math’s objectivity is secured by being part of the one necessary being’s thought. | **Ultra-Rationalist.** Spinoza’s *Ethics* is written geometrically, with axioms and propositions. It’s a tightly reasoned system allowing very little room for whimsy. There is a certain austere elegance (almost poetic in its logical grandeur), but overall it’s rigor and logic all the way – he even dismisses free will as an illusion to preserve coherence. | **Low.** Not empirically driven (Spinoza starts from definitions of God, substance, etc., not experiments). It yields no specific testable predictions; it’s a philosophical explanation of known reality. | **High.** Consistent and exhaustive. Spinoza’s system is so self-contained that it’s sometimes criticized as *too* rigid. By definition, contradictions are banned (anything that would contradict the one substance’s unity or necessity is rejected). The logic is powerful – e.g. if only one substance can exist, you automatically can’t have any conflicting entities. | **High.** Perhaps the ultimate in unification: **mind and matter are just two “attributes”** of the one entity. Everything – physical, mental, moral – is unified as expressions of one cosmic being. The distinction between different things is only a partial perspective; underlying all is the same substance. | **High.** Spinoza answers profound questions head-on: *Why do things exist?* Because the one infinite Substance exists by its own nature. *Why this world?* Because everything that happens follows necessarily from the nature of God/Nature (nothing could be otherwise). There are no brute facts – even human actions and thoughts are “explained” as necessary outcomes of this one reality’s modifications. | **High.** Ontologically extremely economical: only **one** substance (monism). While that one substance has infinitely many aspects, Spinoza argues we only know two (mind and extension). Still, by not multiplying fundamental kinds, it’s maximally parsimonious. | **High.** The core of Spinoza’s view is that the one Substance (God or Nature) **necessarily exists** (he even gives a proof in Ethics Part I, Prop. 11: an absolutely infinite being cannot be conceived not to exist ([Baruch Spinoza - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/#:~:text=Baruch%20Spinoza%20,and%20infinite%20essence%2C%20necessarily%20exists))). Everything else is necessary *given* that substance’s existence (all occurs with logical necessity from God’s nature). So reality **must** be as it is, in Spinoza’s eyes – contingency is an illusion of our limited perspective. |
| **Panpsychism** <br>(*ubiquitous consciousness in all matter*) | **Low/Medium.** It doesn’t remove the usual physical contingencies (the existence of the universe, its laws, etc. are taken as given), but it adds the **postulate** that basic physical entities have mind-like aspect. So it still faces the question “why is there something rather than nothing?” as much as materialism does. However, it avoids one contingency that physicalism has: it doesn’t treat consciousness as a wholly new emergent miracle – instead it’s built in from the start (so it *completes* the picture of nature by ensuring mind isn’t left unexplained). | **Medium.** Does not *explain* physics per se; it largely accepts the same physical laws. But by insisting that mental properties accompany physical ones, it can potentially inform interpretations of quantum mechanics or other fields (e.g. some panpsychists suggest that quantum indeterminacy might be tied to rudimentary “choices” of particles). Generally, though, it’s an add-on to physics, not a deeper physical theory. | **Low.** Math is usually outside panpsychism’s scope. Mathematical truths and structures aren’t inherently explained by saying electrons have proto-experience. (Panpsychism is a solution to the mind-matter problem, not the math-physics correspondence problem.) | **Rational.** Panpsychism in contemporary philosophy is presented as a logical inference: since dualism is disunified and physicalism struggles with explaining consciousness, we adopt a simple, uniform solution ([Panpsychism - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/#:~:text=between%20physicalism%20on%20the%20one,a%20unified%20conception%20of%20nature)). It’s not based on mystic revelation but on philosophical argument (though it certainly *sounds* exotic at first). | **Low.** No clear empirical tests uniquely confirm panpsychism. It is largely evaluated by conceptual plausibility. (Some have mused about whether integrated information measures could indirectly indicate consciousness in simple systems, but that’s speculative.) Mostly, it’s unfalsifiable – the world would look the same externally whether electrons have an “inner life” or not. | **Medium.** It’s internally coherent as a general idea (mind is fundamental and everywhere), but it faces the **combination problem**: how do countless tiny consciousnesses combine into the unified consciousness we humans have? This is an unresolved internal puzzle (not a straight contradiction, but a gap in the theory’s account). Otherwise, it preserves logical consistency by aligning mind with existing physical structure one-to-one. | **High.** Aims to **unify mind and matter** at the most basic level: there is no radical divide; every piece of matter has a mental aspect. In effect, it’s a monism (everything is one type of thing: “mind-stuff” that has internal (experiential) and external (physical) faces). This avoids the disjointed worldview of dualism and the “gaping explanatory hole” of materialism regarding consciousness ([Panpsychism - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/#:~:text=between%20physicalism%20on%20the%20one,a%20unified%20conception%20of%20nature)). | **Medium.** It gives a somewhat deeper picture of why consciousness exists (because it’s a fundamental feature of reality, not an accident). However, it doesn’t necessarily explain *why* reality has this feature or *why* particular structures of consciousness correspond to particular physical structures – it mostly shifts the explanation to “that’s just how fundamental reality is.” It does address why consciousness *doesn’t come from nothing* (because it was there all along), which is a non-trivial improvement in depth on physicalism’s account. | **Medium.** In one sense it’s simpler than dualism (no separate supernatural soul substance – just one kind of stuff with two facets). But it’s less parsimonious than strict materialism because it attributes an extra property (mentality) to everything. Proponents argue it’s a **modest addition** that yields explanatory payoff (solving an otherwise insoluble problem), thus worth the complexity. | **Low.** Typically does not invoke any necessary being or law – it usually assumes the natural world with consciousness is just the way it is (some panpsychist views are combined with a cosmopsychism that the universe as a whole is a mind, but even then it’s usually not framed as “necessarily so” but rather a contingent fact of our world). |
| **Process Philosophy** <br>(Whitehead’s **process metaphysics**)<br>(*reality as events and relations, not static substances*) | **Medium.** It rejects the idea of permanent substances or inexplicable brute matter; everything is a dynamic **process** with reasons (each event arises from prior conditions and a teleological lure). It aspires to leave no “thing” hanging without context – every event is constituted by its relations. However, the ultimate principles (like the fact of creativity or God’s existence in Whitehead’s system) are themselves somewhat given rather than derived, so some contingency may remain at the very base. | **Medium.** It offers a framework where physics can be reconceived: e.g. space, time, and matter are emergent from networks of fundamental events (“actual occasions”). Whitehead’s process model was meant to be consonant with relativity and quantum theory, and later process theorists (like Cahill’s **Process Physics**) try to derive space or particles from self-organizing information processes. While it hasn’t *supplanted* standard physics, it does propose a way that physics’ laws might emerge from deeper relational processes. | **Low/Medium.** Whitehead introduced “eternal objects” (abstract forms) to account for patterns – somewhat like Platonic forms as potentialities that actual occasions realize. This gives a place for mathematical entities (as a subset of eternal objects) in the metaphysics. It explains why math applies to the world: those patterns are part of the universe’s basic ingredients. However, it doesn’t *derive* specific math truths; it just ensures they have ontological status. | **Both Logical and Poetic.** Whitehead’s writing mixes precise philosophical concepts with almost poetic imagery (“the universe is a creative advance into novelty”). It’s logically structured (with categories and principles), but the style and concepts (prehension, concrescence) can feel abstractly poetic. It’s a marriage of mysticism about an interrelated cosmos with meticulous metaphysical reasoning. | **Low.** Not directly testable. (Though process philosophy influenced some scientific theories, you can’t point a telescope and see an “actual occasion.”) Its value is in interpretation and synthesis, not prediction. | **High.** It’s a well-elaborated system with careful definitions. By replacing substances with interrelated processes, it avoids certain classical paradoxes (e.g. how a static substance can change – in process thought, reality *is* change). The inclusion of God in Whitehead’s system adds complexity, but even that is integrated systematically. There are no blatant contradictions, but certainly a lot of complexity to reconcile. | **High.** Great integrative power: integrates **mind, matter, life, and even God** are all seen as part of one process of becoming. It dissolves hard dichotomies – e.g. mind and matter differ in degree, not in fundamental kind (each experience is a process that has “physical” and “mental” prehensions). The whole cosmos is a web of interrelations ([Alfred North Whitehead - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead#:~:text=attention%20from%20mathematics%20to%20philosophy,foundational%20texts%20of%20process%20philosophy)), which naturally brings diverse phenomena into one coherent whole. | **High.** Aims to answer not just *what* reality is but *why it is dynamic and interconnected*. It tackles the question of how novelty and creativity enter the world (something static block-universe views don’t easily explain). It reframes *why* we have stable structures (due to repetition of processes) and *why* we have change (reality is intrinsically generative). It’s an attempt at a “deep story” of the universe’s form and development, not just a surface description. | **Low/Medium.** It abandons simple substances for a rather elaborate schema of processes, relations, and a dipolar deity (in Whitehead’s version). The ontology has many moving parts (literally). Admirers see this as necessary complexity (reality *is* complex), but it’s certainly not as parsimonious as a one-substance or one-equation theory. | **Medium.** Whitehead posits a form of **necessary creativity** as the ultimate principle (there must always be a process of becoming). He also posits God (as the primordial ordering of possibilities and the everlastingly evolving companion to the world) as a necessary aspect of reality’s structure. However, because his God is not the creator *ex nihilo* (more of a co-eternal principle), the necessity is more abstract – it’s a necessity of process itself and the presence of an ideal ordering principle. The world as we know it is then a result of these necessary elements interacting, making existence in some form necessary, but the specific details contingent. |
| **Digital Physics / Simulation Theory** <br>(*reality as information or computation*) | **Low.** Often introduces an extra contingent layer (e.g. “our universe is a program running in some other reality” – it shifts the contingency up one level to the simulator or the binary bits). If taken in the broad sense (Wheeler’s “It from Bit”), it posits information as fundamental but usually doesn’t say *why* there is information or a cosmic computer to begin with. So the existence of the “computer” or binary lattice is a brute fact in most versions. | **High.** This approach directly targets physics: the idea is that physical laws arise from an underlying informational or computational process. E.g. John Wheeler suggested that physical phenomena ultimately reduce to binary yes/no bits ([John Archibald Wheeler quote: It from bit symbolizes the idea that every item of...](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/712155#:~:text=,this%20is%20a%20participatory%20universe)). Some digital physics models try to derive space-time and particles from cellular automata or quantum information theory. If true, it *would* explain why physics has a mathematical form (because the universe is literally executing algorithms). So far, it’s speculative, but it does provide a conceptual mechanism for physics: the world is essentially a running **program**. | **Medium.** In **strong** versions like the *Mathematical Universe Hypothesis* or Wheeler’s vision, math/information is the fundamental reality, which inherently explains math (math is “real” because the universe *is* math or algorithms). But many simulation theorists take the program itself as given, not explaining math’s truth generally. (If the universe is a simulation, mathematics is just the code of the simulation – we explain our universe’s math by saying it’s the simulator’s choice, but we don’t explain why those mathematical rules versus others, except perhaps anthropic reasons.) | **Rational/Scientific.** Tends to be an extension of scientific reasoning – it tries to reduce physics to simpler informational rules. It’s often presented in logical terms (computational models, bits, automata). It does have a somewhat imaginative side (our reality “like a video game”), but proponents treat it as a rigorous hypothesis, not metaphor. | **Medium.** Some aspects *could* be testable: e.g. a simulation might have resolution limits or anomalies (people have proposed looking for pixelation in high-energy cosmic ray spectra or unexpected constraints that hint we’re on a lattice). No definitive test has succeeded, but it’s not inherently untestable if our simulation has telltale features. (If it’s just “it from bit” with no outside simulator, then it becomes harder to test directly, but it might predict that continuous physics will break down into discrete information at small scales, which is partially testable.) | **High.** Generally consistent logically: viewing physics as emergent from computation doesn’t introduce contradictions – it mostly recasts known physics in a different ontological light. If one posits an external simulator, one has to be careful to avoid self-contradiction (like infinite regress of who simulates the simulator), but usually the scenario is kept self-consistent by not requiring an infinite chain (the “base reality” can be left unspecified). | **High.** Unifies physical reality with **information** – matter, energy, space, and time are seen as manifestations of an underlying informational substrate or code. This ties together diverse phenomena (everything from quantum events to cosmic structure) as results of one computational rule-set. In a way, it also can unify mind and matter if one imagines consciousness as information processing, fitting into the same digital framework. | **Medium.** It provides a deeper explanation in that it says *what* the physical world fundamentally is (bits, programs) rather than just describing its behavior. However, if one asks “Why this program? Why any program at all?” most digital theorists haven’t answered that fully (unless combined with something like Tegmark’s idea that all possible programs exist). It does reduce the mystery of *how* a universe can exist by likening it to something we know how to make (a computer simulation), but it can simply relocate the ultimate mystery. | **Medium.** Potentially very simple at root: e.g. a few bits and rules could generate immense complexity. Some cellular-automaton theories seek an elegant, simple rule (like Conway’s Game of Life but 3D) that produces our physics. In practice, no one has found *a single simple program* that yields our Standard Model of physics, so current models either remain toy models or require intricate tuning. The **simulation argument** variant isn’t about simplicity at all (it even adds an entire higher universe of simulators), so parsimony varies widely in this category. | **Low.** Typically treats the foundational information or the simulator as contingent. (Bostrom’s simulation argument, for instance, is entirely contingent on empirical civilizations deciding to run sims.) A minority view like philosopher Jürgen Schmidhuber’s all-computable-universes idea or Tegmark’s ensemble suggests maybe all possible codes run “somewhere” by mathematical necessity, but that’s not a standard simulation hypothesis. So usually, there’s no claim that the bits or program *must* exist; it’s just a hypothesis about what *does* exist. |
| **Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (Tegmark)** <br>(*reality = mathematics*) | **High.** Abolishes contingency by asserting that every self-consistent mathematical structure exists *as* a universe. Our world’s existence is no longer a puzzle – it’s one of the “ensemble” of all mathematical realities. In this view, it would actually be more puzzling for a math structure *not* to exist. (There’s no brute fact that “these laws exist” – all possible laws exist, and we find ourselves in one of them.) | **High.** Directly identifies physical reality with a particular mathematical structure ([The Universe Is Made Of Mathematics - Issue 113 - Philosophy Now](https://philosophynow.org/issues/113/The_Universe_Is_Made_Of_Mathematics#:~:text=grabbing%20name%2C%20the%20Mathematical%20Universe,and%20at%20first%20glance%20it%E2%80%99s)). Physics is thus “explained” because at bottom the world *just is* a mathematical object. E.g. if our universe is isomorphic to a certain set of equations, that’s not just a description – that *is* what our universe is ontologically. This means things like particle content and forces are as they are because those correspond to features of that mathematical structure. (It doesn’t derive the equations from deeper principles – it flat-out states the equations are real – but it explains why nature is mathematical: because nature = math.) | **High.** Mathematics is fundamental reality. All mathematical truths are true *because* they exist as structures in the platonic sense. Tegmark’s hypothesis is explicitly that “our external physical reality is a mathematical structure” ([The Universe Is Made Of Mathematics - Issue 113 - Philosophy Now](https://philosophynow.org/issues/113/The_Universe_Is_Made_Of_Mathematics#:~:text=grabbing%20name%2C%20the%20Mathematical%20Universe,and%20at%20first%20glance%20it%E2%80%99s)) and indeed **“only mathematics exists”** ([The Universe Is Made Of Mathematics - Issue 113 - Philosophy Now](https://philosophynow.org/issues/113/The_Universe_Is_Made_Of_Mathematics#:~:text=hypothesis%20goes%20well%20beyond%20Platonism%2C,is%20known%20as%20mathematical%20monism)). Thus, it puts mathematics at the core of ontology – the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics is no surprise if the world is, literally, math. | **Rationalist.** It’s a bold but strictly logical proposal: assume no ontological primitives except mathematical structures. It’s articulated in scientific papers and books with careful reasoning about symmetry and simplicity. There’s little “poetic” about Tegmark’s style; it’s more of an extreme rational extrapolation of scientific realism and Platonism. | **Low.** This is a very sweeping metaphysical claim with no direct empirical test (any conceivable observation can be attributed to “that’s the math structure we are in”). It does, however, potentially make itself falsifiable if our universe turned out not to be describable by any math (but so far the opposite is true – math fits perfectly). It doesn’t give unique new predictions; it’s more a principle that *postdicts* why physics works. | **High.** Internally, it’s straightforward: if something is mathematically inconsistent it cannot exist; everything that is consistent (mathematically possible) exists somewhere. It avoids internal paradox by construction (each universe is a self-consistent structure). The theory faces philosophical challenges (like how to interpret probability or “which structure are we in?”) but it’s not internally contradictory – just unusual. | **High.** Ultimate unification: **physics and math become one**. Also, all phenomena are unified under one principle: they are aspects of a mathematical form. There’s no separate “physical stuff” and “math truths” – a photon, a thought, a geometry, etc., are all part of the same grand mathematical object. In a sense, it even unifies *all possible worlds* into one framework (the ensemble of structures). | **High.** Tackles the deepest question of existence: *Why does this universe exist?* Answer: it had to, because all mathematically possible universes do. The only “why” left is *why mathematics?* – to which the Tegmarkian might say mathematics is the ultimate neutral starting point (anything else would be an arbitrary assumption). It doesn’t leave the existence of our universe as an unanswered brute fact; it embeds it in a very deep context where existence = logical/mathematical possibility. | **High (in principle).** In one stroke, it posits a single kind of thing (mathematical structure) and discards anything non-mathematical. It is a very parsimonious ontology – arguably **the** simplest (no special substances, just abstract structures). The catch is that it implies a *vast* “collection” of structures (indeed an infinity of universes), but that plurality comes from a single principle rather than ad hoc choices. | **Medium/High.** If one accepts the axioms of logic/math as necessary, then in this view existence flows from those necessarily. However, Tegmark doesn’t offer a proof that “math must exist” – he assumes a form of mathematical Platonism (abstract truths are “out there” in a sense). He argues that assuming only math exists is more natural and avoids arbitrary picking-and-choosing of what exists. So while not everyone agrees that it’s *metaphysically necessary* that all math exists, within the hypothesis it is treated as such (anything that can exist, does). |
| **CTMU (Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe)** <br>(*Langan’s self-configuring reality theory*) | **High.** The CTMU explicitly aims to be an **ultimate self-contained explanation** – reality is seen as a self-consistent logical structure that includes its own explanation. It avoids contingencies by claiming reality is *self-defined* and *self-caused*. According to Langan, the theory has **“no assumptions or arguable assertions”** – it’s derived from logic itself ([An Introduction to Mathematical Metaphysics - Cosmos and History: The Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy](https://cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/618#:~:text=mathematical%20ingredients,dual%20metaphysical%20identity)). All aspects of existence are supposed to follow necessarily from this framework, leaving no brute fact outside the model. | **High.** CTMU attempts to explain physics by treating the universe as a **self-processing language** or logical structure. Physical laws are seen as rules of that language. It purports to resolve issues in cosmology and quantum mechanics by viewing reality as **infocognitive** (information = cognition). In essence, physics is an emergent syntax of the universe’s self-configuration. (It addresses why physical laws have the form of mathematical logic – because reality *is* a logical self-model.) It is very abstract, but it does claim to preserve “virtually all of the major benefits of current scientific theories” while resolving their paradoxes ([The Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe: A New Kind of ...](https://www.amazon.com/Cognitive-Theoretic-Model-Universe-Reality-Theory/dp/0971916225#:~:text=The%20Cognitive,of%20current%20scientific%20and)). | **High.** Mathematics is integral to CTMU’s formulation – the universe is described as a mathematical/logical structure that *contains* and *generates* mathematics as part of its self-model. Langan defines metaphysics itself as a “logically idempotent **metalinguistic identity** of reality” coupling perceptual reality and formal mind ([An Introduction to Mathematical Metaphysics - Cosmos and History: The Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy](https://cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/618#:~:text=Since%20the%20time%20of%20Aristotle%2C%20by%20replacing%20dualism%20with%20the)). In CTMU, logic and math are not external truths but embedded in reality’s fabric. So it aims to explain math’s effectiveness by saying reality is a *self-consistent formal system*. | **Extremely Rationalist.** CTMU is framed in strict logical terms, with new terminology to ensure precision. It reads somewhat like mathematical logic meets ontology. Langan deliberately positions it as free of unsupported metaphysical “leaps” – everything is meant to be deduced. (Some readers find the prose dense or esoteric, but it’s not poetic in the traditional sense; it’s intended as pure reasoning.) ([An Introduction to Mathematical Metaphysics - Cosmos and History: The Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy](https://cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/618#:~:text=mathematical%20ingredients,dual%20metaphysical%20identity)) | **Low.** It’s not formulated in a directly testable way. CTMU is more of a *metaphysical mega-theory* than a set of empirical predictions. It aims to be *consistent with* all empirical data and perhaps suggest new ways of thinking about anomalies, but there’s no clear-cut experiment that would falsify or verify the CTMU specifically. Its claims (like “the universe self-simulates”) are too overarching to pin down experimentally at present. | **High.** The CTMU is constructed to be **internally consistent** – it’s basically a requirement of the theory that reality cannot contradict itself (since it’s self-contained and self-consistent by definition). It introduces concepts like “SCSPL” (Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language) to formally avoid paradox. While critics sometimes argue it’s difficult to penetrate, outright logical contradictions haven’t been demonstrated in its structure; it strives for airtight logical closure. | **High.** It explicitly unifies **mind and matter**: “the global coupling or superposition of mind and physical reality in a self-dual metaphysical identity” ([An Introduction to Mathematical Metaphysics - Cosmos and History: The Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy](https://cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/618#:~:text=resolves%20the%20problems%20attending%20Cartesian,dual%20metaphysical%20identity)). Reality contains and unifies the observer with the observed in a single self-referential system. It’s a theory of **everything** in a strong sense – aiming to integrate physics, cognition, mathematics, and philosophy into one model. Few theories attempt such breadth of unification. | **High.** CTMU seeks to answer *why reality exists and why it has the features it does* by essentially saying **reality is the way it is because it could not be otherwise without contradiction**. It builds an explanatory chain where existence is seen as logically necessary (it even argues that **true Nothingness is impossible**, hence Somethingness exists of necessity). It doesn’t just restate the problems; it asserts solutions (e.g. resolving Cartesian dualism via reality’s “self-duality” ([An Introduction to Mathematical Metaphysics - Cosmos and History: The Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy](https://cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/618#:~:text=This%20structure%2C%20called%20the%20Cognitive,dual%20metaphysical%20identity)), addressing cosmological questions via reality’s self-generation, etc.). | **Medium.** Langan claims the CTMU uses only a few *very simple* ingredients (like tautologies and self-reference principles) ([An Introduction to Mathematical Metaphysics - Cosmos and History: The Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy](https://cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/618#:~:text=Since%20the%20time%20of%20Aristotle%2C,of%20the%20Universe%20or%20CTMU)), so in *principle* it’s parsimonious. However, the formulation introduces many neologisms and complex structures, which gives an *appearance* of high complexity. In terms of assumptions, it tries to minimize them (ideally to zero, relying instead on necessities); but in terms of comprehension, it’s not “simple” for a reader. | **High.** A core idea is that *existence is logically necessary* – “nothingness is inherently contradictory and therefore impossible,” so **Somethingness is necessary**. The CTMU’s self-contained universe is effectively a necessary entity: it exists because non-existence could not consistently be the case. Thus, it firmly attempts to satisfy the criterion of metaphysical necessity (the universe couldn’t not exist, in this model, and its properties stem from self-consistency rather than arbitrariness). |
| **Analytic Idealism** (Kastrup’s **monistic idealism**) <br>(*reality = universal consciousness*) | **High.** It posits a single fundamental substance: **consciousness** (an impersonal, universal mind). All apparently separate things are manifestations of this mind. Thus, it avoids unexplained dualities or base matter – nothing is left outside the one psyche. There is no need for contingent matter or separate laws; everything happens as patterns of consciousness. (It does, however, ultimately leave the existence of this one mind as a given – but since that mind is all-encompassing and self-existent, it functions as an ultimate, non-contingent ground.) | **Medium.** Physics is explained as the **“extrinsic appearance”** of mental activity ([On how the world is felt - Bernardo Kastrup, PhD, PhD](https://www.bernardokastrup.com/2014/09/on-how-world-is-felt.html#:~:text=derive%20from%20this%20point%3A%20Although,no%20life%20in%20the%20universe)). In other words, what we call physical processes are how certain experiential processes look from an outside perspective. Bernardo Kastrup uses analogies like a whirlpool in water: the whirlpool (a localized excitation of mind-at-large) from the inside is an experience, from the outside (to another observer) appears as a brain with neurons firing. This means physics is not fundamental but is lawful because the underlying mind-at-large behaves consistently. It provides a conceptual explanation for why there are stable physical laws (they’re the habitual dynamics of the one mind), but it doesn’t derive specific numerical laws – it reinterprets them. | **Low/Medium.** Mathematics isn’t a primary focus. One might say math is a way the one mind structures its contents; mathematical objects could be patterns of thought in mind-at-large. Kastrup’s idealism doesn’t propose that “everything *is* math” – rather, everything is experience. Math’s effectiveness could be explained by saying that the universal consciousness operates with an inherent logical structure (thus yielding stable ratios and patterns we describe mathematically). This is plausible but not elaborated in detail; math remains a bit of a side issue. | **Rational.** Kastrup calls it “analytic” idealism because it’s grounded in rigorous argumentation (drawing from analytic philosophy and empirical findings in psychology/neuroscience). He carefully addresses potential logical pitfalls (like avoiding solipsism by positing an impersonal mind beyond individual persons). While the content (universal consciousness) can sound mystical, he strives to articulate it in clear, reasoned terms rather than poetry or vague mysticism. | **Low.** There’s no direct experiment to show “mind-at-large.” However, Kastrup does appeal to empirical adequacy: for example, brain imaging correlations with experience are accounted for (brain activity is just the image of conscious processes ([On how the world is felt - Bernardo Kastrup, PhD, PhD](https://www.bernardokastrup.com/2014/09/on-how-world-is-felt.html#:~:text=My%20philosophy%20entails%20that%20the,measurements%20showing%20a%20clearly%20discernible))), and he suggests his model is consistent with psychic phenomena or anomalies better than materialism. Still, those are more about consistency than unique testable predictions. No straightforward scientific test can confirm “we’re all alters of one mind.” | **High.** Internally coherent as a modern monism. It avoids the classical mind-body contradiction by making them the same essence. He carefully handles the “multiple minds” issue by using the notion of dissociation: the one mind can segment itself into semi-independent “alters” (like multiple personalities) which correspond to individual beings. This explains why each of us has a private perspective while still being part of one whole. As long as one accepts the analogy, there’s no internal contradiction – it’s a cohesive narrative of how one reality appears as many. | **High.** It unifies **everything under consciousness**. The physical world, life, and mind are all explained as manifestations of one cosmic Mind (often dubbed *Mind-at-Large* ([On how the world is felt - Bernardo Kastrup, PhD, PhD](https://www.bernardokastrup.com/2014/09/on-how-world-is-felt.html#:~:text=I%20also%20do%20not%20deny,no%20life%20in%20the%20universe))). This dissolves traditional dualisms: matter vs mind, subject vs object (they’re all aspects of one entity). It’s quite powerful in bringing diverse phenomena into one explanatory fold – for instance, mental phenomena aren’t “other than” the rest of nature; they are nature’s inner aspect. | **High.** Provides a deep narrative: *Why are we here?* Because we are dissociated alters of the one mind, experiencing itself. *Why does the world exist?* Because that is what consciousness does – it exists and mental images (our universe) arise within it. It doesn’t settle for “consciousness just emerges when matter is arranged a certain way” (which is a brute fact in materialism); instead it inverts it – matter emerges from consciousness. It addresses the hard problem of consciousness by saying it’s only hard if you start from matter – start from mind and the rest becomes the puzzle (which it answers by saying matter is just how mind looks from outside). In short, it attempts to answer both the existence of mind and matter in one stroke (mind is fundamental, matter is how minds interact). | **High.** As a form of **monism**, it is simpler than dualism or pluralism. Only one fundamental kind of thing (consciousness) is posited. Kastrup’s formulation doesn’t require extra arbitrary entities; even things like space, time, and physics are emergent appearances, not additional fundamentals. One might argue whether introducing a universal consciousness is “simpler” than physics – but structurally, it’s one postulate replacing many. The theory is built to be as simple as possible (one substance) while still explaining the richness of experience. | **Medium.** It asserts that the existence of the one consciousness is the *only* logical way to avoid the contradictions of dualism and the incompleteness of materialism – thus implicitly that it’s necessary (since other stances fail to account for reality). However, it doesn’t prove that a cosmic consciousness *had* to exist; it assumes it as the best explanation. In practice, the one mind is treated as the self-existent ground (not requiring further explanation) – analogous to how a theist treats God or a materialist treats the Big Bang singularity. So reality, in this view, is necessary *if* you accept that nothing else could explain it better, but the theory stops short of an ontological proof of necessity. |
| **Thomas Campbell’s “My Big TOE”** <br>(*Reality as a simulation by a Larger Consciousness System*) | **High.** It proposes an encompassing reality (LCS – Larger Consciousness System) that *necessarily* exists as the fundamental being, within which our universe is a designed simulation. All things happen for a reason: to evolve consciousness. By embedding everything (physical and non-physical) in one purposeful system, it leaves no loose explanatory threads. (Some might question if the LCS itself is assumed without explanation, but Campbell implies it just exists and always has, sort of an original consciousness – so it’s an ultimate given, not a contingent object.) | **High.** In this model, **physical reality is a digital virtual reality** run by the LCS ([My Big TOE - Awakening, Discovey, Inner Workings - Summary, Quotes, FAQ, Audio](https://sobrief.com/books/my-big-toe#:~:text=substance%20of%20reality%2C%20with%20everything,challenging%20traditional%20views%20of%20existence)). This gives a straightforward explanation for physics: the “ruleset” of the simulation are the laws of physics. Things like the speed of light could be limitations of the simulation’s resolution or processing speed; quantum randomness could be pseudorandom computation, etc. Campbell actually tries to account for why C is constant, why particles seem probabilistic, etc., by analogy to how a simulation would operate. Thus, physics is no longer brute – it’s the chosen rule-set for an “experiential game” that consciousness plays. | **Low/Medium.** Mathematics in MBT is seen as part of the rule-set of the virtual reality – essentially the programming of the simulation. It explains that our universe adheres to mathematical laws because it’s implemented algorithmically. But it doesn’t claim all math exists (only the math used by the system). Nor does it give a deeper reason for math itself; math is simply the language the LCS uses to configure the simulation. (So math is important as the simulation’s code, but beyond that it’s not a separate focus.) | **Rational + Intuitive.** Campbell’s theory is laid out systematically in three books and uses a lot of logical argument and even some diagrams. It’s meant to be internally logical and consistent with science. However, it’s also driven by Campbell’s personal explorations (e.g. out-of-body experiences) and has a strong spiritual flavor (evolving toward love, lowering entropy of consciousness). He encourages open-minded skepticism and builds from first principles, but includes what some might see as “new age” elements couched in logical terms. Overall, he strives for rational explanation of traditionally mystical ideas (like an afterlife being just logging out of the simulation, etc.). | **Low/Medium.** As a TOE, it isn’t confirmed by experiment. Some followers argue it could account for paranormal phenomena or allow one to test reality via consciousness (e.g. achieving out-of-body states to explore beyond physical reality as a kind of personal experiment). But for mainstream empirical science, it’s not testable on demand. (He does suggest in interviews certain possible tests for virtual reality, but these overlap with general simulation hypothesis tests, none of which have yielded clear results.) | **Medium.** It’s a large conceptual scheme, but it doesn’t contain obvious self-contradictions. One potential point: it mixes a teleological “purpose” (consciousness evolution) into the system, which some might see as injecting a non-falsifiable element. Internally though, MBT is structured: the LCS evolves, it spawns simulations, individuated units of consciousness interact, etc., all in a rule-governed way. It’s logically possible, though hard to verify consistency of *every* detail since some are qualitative. So far, critics may find it unconvincing, but not internally incoherent. | **High.** Extremely integrative. It unifies **physical reality, consciousness, paranormal phenomena, spirituality** – everything – in one fell swoop. In MBT, there is no fundamental divide between science and spirituality: physics is just a subset of a larger reality. Mind and matter are unified because matter is a simulation output for minds to experience. All aspects of existence (facts and values, “outer” and “inner”) come under one framework of a multi-layered consciousness system. | **High.** It addresses “big questions”: *Why are we here?* – To grow the quality of consciousness (lower entropy of the system). *Why is there a universe?* – As a training ground, a virtual reality for consciousness to interact and evolve. *What is the meaning of life?* – Love and entropy reduction in the context of that evolution. It doesn’t leave existence meaningless or physics unexplained; it claims a profound purpose and mechanism behind them. The depth is considerable, weaving a narrative from the origin of reality to the destiny of consciousness. | **Medium.** On one hand, it’s monistic (everything is basically information/consciousness), which is simple. On the other, it lays out a fairly elaborate cosmology (with multiple reality frames, different rule-sets, a complex mechanics of reincarnation, etc.). It’s not as lean as some purely logical theories; it’s trying to map a lot of phenomena. However, Campbell emphasizes that a few core assumptions generate the rest. The intuitive sense is that it’s **less parsimonious than a minimalist physics TOE**, but more parsimonious than having separate unrelated explanations for physics, consciousness, and spirituality – he combines them, which arguably simplifies the overall explanatory landscape. | **Medium.** It presupposes a fundamental Consciousness and its drive to evolve, which is treated as just the way reality is (almost analogous to a necessary God). It’s not derived from higher principles – it’s the starting point. That makes the LCS somewhat of a necessary existent in the model (it wasn’t created; it simply is and always was, gradually evolving). But the specific structure of our universe (this particular simulation) is contingent – the LCS could run different simulations or no simulation. So the ground of being (Consciousness) is necessary in MBT, yet the world we experience is a chosen, contingent creation by that ground. |
| **Eidomorphism** (Neven Knežević’s **Ontological Mathematics**) <br>(*reality = “minded” mathematical energy*) | **High.** It explicitly seeks an **utterly simple, metaphysically necessary substance** that can serve as the self-contained origin of everything. Eidomorphism posits reality is made of fundamental *eidomorphic monads* – dimensionless points defined by Euler’s formula – which exist necessarily and contain the reason for all phenomena. By grounding existence in this necessary mathematical structure, it avoids any arbitrary axioms or unexplained contingencies (addressing Hume’s problem of causation, Kant’s problems, Münchhausen’s trilemma, etc., all in “one fell swoop” according to Knežević). | **High.** It **philosophically grounds physics**: concepts like energy, space, time, mass, charge, etc., are said to *emerge from* or *correspond to* features of the fundamental complex waves of the monadic substance. In Eidomorphism, Euler’s formula $e^{i\pi}+1=0$ (which combines fundamental mathematical constants) is seen as the core structure of reality, and the “flowing points” (monads) executing sinusoidal waves generate physical phenomena. Essentially, it provides a derivational substrate for physics – what string theory tries to do with strings, Eidomorphism does with complex oscillations of mind-like points. It even claims these entities *contain in themselves the necessary principles for quantum mechanics and the entirety of physics*, suggesting that physical laws can be logically derived from the properties of the monadic waves. | **High.** Mathematics *is* the fabric of reality here. Eidomorphism is dubbed *“the philosophy of ontological mathematics.”* It asserts that **“all that exists is minded mathematical energy following the structure of the Euler formula.”**. So mathematical structures (like complex numbers, waves, etc.) aren’t just descriptors of reality – they are ontological. It thereby explains why mathematics so perfectly describes the world: the world *is* fundamentally a mathematical form (with mind). Mathematical truths, especially those in Euler’s formula and related structures, are built into the fundamental substance of existence. | **Rationalist (with mathematical rigor).** Knežević’s work pays homage to Leibniz and is structured with definitions, proofs, and logical argumentation. It’s essentially a modern *monadology* in mathematical dress. While it’s an imaginative leap to tie everything to Euler’s formula, the approach is heavily analytical: deriving consequences, addressing philosophical problems in a step-by-step logical way, and updating classical rationalism with contemporary math. It’s not about mystical pronouncements; it’s about demonstrating an internally coherent system (the text even includes formal proofs). | **Low.** As a metaphysical theory, it’s not directly testable. However, it stakes out territory that interfaces with physics and philosophy of mind, which means if those fields find contradictions (say, a physical phenomenon that fundamentally can’t be described by sinusoidal components, or an aspect of consciousness not accounted for), the theory would be challenged. It aligns with known physics (using complex waves like those in quantum theory), but it hasn’t provided a unique experimental prediction that could confirm or falsify it. | **High.** The theory is constructed to be logically airtight, using an axiomatic approach. It tries to **“overcome Münchhausen’s trilemma”** by founding everything on a necessary truth (Euler’s identity and its implications). By design, it strives to avoid self-contradiction – any feature of reality that would contradict the Eulerian monadic model is either explained or would refute the theory. So far, as a self-contained philosophy, it maintains consistency by carefully defining its core and deducing everything from it. | **High.** Eidomorphism **unifies mind and matter** (each monad has an interior aspect – a unit of experience or *quale* – and an external mathematical form). It’s effectively a form of **panpsychist mathematical monism**: one kind of entity has both mental and mathematical-physical character. It also unifies disparate fields: logic, math, physics, and even epistemology and ontology all come together in one framework. It claims to solve the mind-body problem, Hume’s problem of induction, and other dualities by means of one simple substance. Everything from quantum behavior to the flow of time is supposed to integrate into the single structure of interacting complex waves in monads. | **High.** The theory goes beyond just positing a substance – it digs into *how* that substance gives rise to all phenomena. It provides answers, for example, to *why* causality and induction work (because all events are expressions of the underlying necessary rational structure), *why* our minds have reason (because reason is built into the ontological math of reality, not just our brains), and *why* quantum mechanics has its form (monadic interactions produce quantum behavior). It doesn’t shrug at mysteries; it tries to derive them. The depth is reflected in its ambition to answer questions from multiple philosophers (Kant, Hume, Popper) with one coherent model. | **High.** It posits **one basic substance** (the complex “flowing point” or monad) and one master equation (Euler’s formula) – an extremely economical basis. Everything else is built up from combinations of sine/cosine waves and their interactions. In a sense, it’s like a TOE with just one element type and one functional form. While the developed theory spans many pages, the principle of parsimony is respected: it’s trying to **explain more with less**. Even consciousness isn’t an extra add-on – it’s imbued from the start (so we’re not forced to introduce new fundamentals later). | **High.** A driving point of Eidomorphism is that the fundamental substance is **metaphysically necessary** – “an eternal, necessary, and analytic metaphysics”. It explicitly states that the core of reality *must* exist and *could not be otherwise*, because it’s grounded in an irrefutable logical structure (they argue that without this, explanation collapses into infinite regress or arbitrariness). Thus, it asserts that reality is the way it is *by necessity*: the monadic Eulerian structure is the only thing that can self-exist and produce a universe that answers its own “why.” In short, it provides what it calls a “sufficiently powerful but simple explanatory theory” such that *nothing* is left as a mere accident. |
| **Data-Logical Metaphysical Theory (DMTheory)** <br>(*Naturalistic “Theory of Everything” via logic and data*) | **High.** DMTheory is explicitly formulated to provide a **“naturalistic ground…for the existence of contingent objects”**. It denies the adequacy of brute facts and insists that all contingent reality must trace back to something non-contingent. In lieu of invoking a deity, it posits an ultimate logical substance/structure (sometimes characterized in terms of *data* and *logic*) that necessarily exists and explains itself. It’s designed to answer “Why this particular world rather than another?” – a question it says only metaphysics (not physics alone) can handle. Thus, it aims for completeness by allowing *no* uncaused “just because” facts – every aspect of reality should have an explanation in the framework. | **High.** While not providing new equations, it seeks to **underpin physics** philosophically. The author notes that even a Grand Unified Theory in physics would be incomplete by itself (since it would still beg the question “why those physical principles?”). DMTheory’s answer is to supply a meta-law or logical principle from which physical laws get their “warrant.” It envisions that once fully fleshed out, it could *“serve as the foundation for the consolidation of the truth of our best physical theories.”* In practice, DMTheory discusses how classical physics, quantum mechanics, etc., could all be seen as emergent from or consistent with the deeper data-logic structure of reality. It doesn’t invalidate current physics – it provides an ultimate reason for *having* those laws rather than others, thereby *explaining* physics rather than altering it. | **Medium.** Mathematics is treated as part of the logical structure of reality. The theory is “datalogical,” meaning it deals with fundamental units of information (data) and logic. It doesn’t go into detail about specific mathematical entities, but it leans on logic (which is closely related to mathematics) as an inherent aspect of the fundamental structure. By insisting that reality’s foundation must be something like an analytic truth or tautology (to avoid contingent premise), it implicitly anchors mathematics (especially logic and set theory) at the base of existence. So math is not an accident; it’s essentially woven into the fabric of the explanation. However, DMTheory’s documentation focuses more on ontological and logical arguments than on deriving math structures, so it’s medium in explicit math explanation. | **Rationalist.** The approach is thoroughly logical. It uses **abductive reasoning** and analysis of concepts like nothingness, existence, logic, etc., to build its case. It explicitly presupposes the laws of logic as universal and invariant, and tries to reason from “incorrigible foundations” (statements that *must* be true). The tone is analytical and rigorous, with careful consideration of criteria for a good explanation. There’s little in the way of metaphor or poetry; it reads as a philosophic proof or derivation. | **Low.** No direct empirical tests are offered. The theory is more about the conceptual preconditions for any empirical world. It strives to be *consistent* with empirical evidence (and indeed criticizes any metaphysics that wouldn’t align with known science), but you can’t point a telescope and see “data-logic.” It’s a framework to make sense of why telescopes and planets and quantum fields exist at all. So, empirical applicability is primarily in providing a coherent interpretation rather than novel predictions. | **High.** Great care is taken to ensure no contradictions. The author even states that if, upon analysis, the theory led to unsatisfactory or contradictory implications, it should be doubted – and conversely, if it survives rigorous analysis without logical flaw, that’s a strong sign of truth. It also explicitly avoids the pitfalls of circular reasoning or infinite regress by construction (that’s the whole point of introducing a necessary ground). The internal argument (e.g. that nothingness is impossible therefore something exists, etc.) is laid out step by step. Unless one finds a hidden assumption to challenge, the internal consistency stands solid. | **High.** The aim is a **Theory of Everything** in the fullest sense – not just unifying forces or particles, but unifying existence, mind, matter, logic, and cosmology. It rejects leaving any sector out. DMTheory tries to reconcile scientific knowledge (Big Bang, evolution, etc.) with a single explanatory principle. It’s naturalistic (so it unifies the scientific worldview with the philosophical need for a ground), and it’s monistic in spirit (seeking one root cause for all phenomena). It even attempts to sideline the God vs. no-God dichotomy by offering a third option that achieves the same explanatory role as God (ultimate cause) without the theological baggage. | **High.** The theory delves into *why* there is something (because absolute nothing is logically untenable), *why* contingent things require a non-contingent explanation (to avoid infinite regress), *why* the universe’s physical constants need explanation (they can’t be answered from within physics itself), etc. It doesn’t just state these as problems; it attempts to solve them by positing a specific fundamental entity (sometimes described in terms of “Data” and “Logic”) that by its nature *must* exist and give rise to everything else. In doing so, it touches on cosmogenesis, the nature of truth, and even consciousness (though the latter is less central in the summary). The explanatory ambition is very deep – to leave no basic “Why” unanswered if possible. | **High.** DMTheory prides itself on **simplicity and parsimony**: it “prefers those theories which are simplest/most parsimonious (fewest assumptions, ideally none that are not absolutely necessary)”. It seeks an **assumption-free** or minimal-assumption basis (hence the emphasis on something like “existence exists” or logical tautologies as the core, which aren’t really assumptions but necessities). The ultimate solution it gestures toward is described as far *simpler* than positing a complex God. So while the write-up is extensive, the underlying principle is meant to be very frugal – perhaps something akin to “Existence = Data + Logic” as the lone premise. | **High.** Central to DMTheory is the assertion that **“Nothingness is impossible; therefore Somethingness is necessary”**. It thereby establishes existence as a necessary fact. Further, it implies that the foundational “Something” (whatever prevents nothingness) exists of logical necessity – it *must* be, and could not be otherwise, since it’s the reason for itself. This is why it can replace a creator god – it serves as the self-existent Ground of Being. By insisting on the Principle of Sufficient Reason (everything must have a reason), it effectively contends that reality’s fundamental layer provides a sufficient reason for itself, hence is necessary. In sum, the theory is built to fulfill metaphysical necessity: reality is the way it is because only that way (with a necessary ground) can it be at all, leaving no room for arbitrary contingencies at the base. |
| **Archeonic Resonance Theory (ART)** <br>(*reality = self-configuring mathematical structure based on Euler's formula; "minded" mathematical energy*) | **High.** ART explicitly aims to be a "self-contained origin of everything." It posits a single, necessary, self-existent foundation (0=0) from which all reality deductively follows, satisfying the Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR) and leaving no arbitrary assumptions or unexplained gaps. It even claims to answer "Why is there something rather than nothing?" | **High.** ART philosophically grounds physics by deriving its fundamental laws and constants (c, ħ, $\gamma$, forces, mass, charge, spin, Standard Model symmetries) as necessary consequences of the underlying 0=0 identity and Euler's Formula within a 6D CP3 spacetime. Physical reality is emergent from archeonic waves and their interference, not an external given. It provides a *derivational substrate* for physics, explaining *why* physical laws have their form. | **High.** Mathematics *is* the fundamental fabric of reality in ART. It identifies 0=0 as the "most fundamental identity" from which all mathematical structures and principles (logic, recursion, complex numbers, wave functions, geometry) are derived as "necessary consequences." Euler's Formula is the "unique complete realisation" of 0=0, meaning mathematical truths are not just descriptive but ontological necessities. | **Extremely Rationalist.** ART is presented with rigorous logical argumentation, definitions, and even formal proofs. It's a systematic and analytical philosophical system built on first principles like the PSR and the identity 0=0. The language is dense and precise, typical of mathematical metaphysics, with no overt poetic elements. | **Low.** As a foundational metaphysical theory, ART is not directly testable by empirical experiments. Its value lies in providing a *consistent and comprehensive explanation* for known scientific principles (physics, quantum mechanics, cosmology) rather than making new, unique predictions. It claims consistency with empirical data but doesn't offer direct falsifiable tests. | **High.** The theory is built on an axiomatic approach, aiming for logical airtightness and self-consistency from the foundational identity 0=0. It actively seeks to "overcome Münchhausen’s trilemma" by grounding everything in necessary truth. Different concepts are claimed to "necessarily follow" or "preserve" identity, ensuring a coherent and contradiction-free system. | **High.** ART achieves a very high degree of unification. It unifies **mind and matter** (implied by "minded" mathematical energy, and the dual aspect of Archeons and CP3). It explicitly integrates **logic, mathematics, physics, and cosmology** under a single principle (0=0 and Euler's Formula). It dissolves traditional dualisms by presenting them as dual aspects of one underlying self-consistent reality. It is a "Theory of Everything" in a strong philosophical sense. | **High.** ART aims to answer the deepest "Why" questions, such as "Why is there something rather than nothing?". It provides a foundational reason for the existence of the universe, the form of physical laws, the nature of consciousness (as part of "minded" energy), and the effectiveness of mathematics, by deriving them all from the core identity principle. It doesn't rely on brute facts, but seeks to explain everything through logical necessity. | **High.** ART prides itself on extreme parsimony. It posits **one fundamental identity (0=0)** and one master equation (Euler's Formula) as its "utterly simple, metaphysically necessary substance." All complexity, multiplicity, and physical phenomena are claimed to "emerge from" or be "deductively forced" by this minimal foundation. While the developed theory is complex, its underlying ontological primitive is singular, explaining "more with less." | **High.** This is a core claim of ART. It explicitly asserts that the fundamental identity (0=0 and its implications, Euler's Formula) exists "necessarily" and "could not be otherwise." It argues that "nothingness is inherently contradictory and therefore impossible," making Somethingness a logical necessity. Reality is the way it is "by necessity" because only such a self-consistent, self-explaining structure can avoid brute facts and infinite regress. |
| **A+theism (Mioism Plus)** <br>(*reality = probabilistic "meta-possibilities" / "sentient artifacts" forming structured reality*) | **Low/Medium.** The theory *claims* to replace brute facts with a single generative substrate (meta-possibilities/sentient artifacts) and addresses "Why is there something rather than nothing?". However, the document explicitly lists "Why Proto-Sentience Rather Than Proto-Neutrality?" and "The Origin of the Origin" as "Still Open" issues (p. 33, 40), admitting that rigorous justification for its *specific* proto-conscious starting point is *lacking*. It posits an ultimate "base-base entity" that "may be logically necessary," but concedes "more rigorous argumentation" is needed to fend off the "brute fact" criticism (p. 40). Thus, it aspires to completeness but does not fully achieve it, leaving a significant, admitted foundational contingency. | **Low/Medium.** The theory *asserts* that physical laws, forces (gravity, electromagnetism), space, time, and physical constants "emerge from" or "arise from" interactions of meta-possibilities and quantum processes (p. 11, 15, 21, 23). It reinterprets physics as a "byproduct of stable probabilistic configurations." However, it provides **conceptual re-descriptions rather than rigorous derivations**. For example, gravity is explained by "compatibility of meta-possibilities" or "matter 'wants' to join" (p. 15), and the speed of light by meta-possibilities needing to "communicate changes" (p. 24). These are analogies, not mathematical or physical derivations from first principles. It also mentions "Quantum fields emerge from need to explain observed physics" (p. 30), which is an *a posteriori* fit, not a *prior* derivation. | **Low.** The theory heavily relies on logical reasoning and concepts like "probabilistic reasoning," "information-based agents," and "Euclidean weighting." It uses terms like "information logic" to ground morality (p. 16) and critiques classical logic (p. 8). However, it does not explicitly explain the ontological nature of mathematics itself, or *why* mathematical truths are universally applicable or necessary. While it states that "mathematical architectures" arise (p. 34), it does not derive or ground mathematical principles beyond implicitly using them as tools for its framework. The document notes that "a mathematical formalism would lend credibility" (p. 40), implying this foundational mathematical derivation is currently absent. | **Both (leans Poetic in practice).** The theory *claims* to be "rational, testable, and falsifiable," emphasizing "scientific rigor" and "information logic" (p. 7, 16). It uses a logical, argumentative structure and critiques other systems systematically. However, its explanations for core mechanisms often employ highly abstract, metaphorical, or re-descriptive language rather than strict formalisms (e.g., "Meta-Possibilities as Lego blocks," "shedding tears," "entropic laboratories," "universe in conversation with itself," "value-preferences bend possibility space") (p. 14, 27, 36, 37, 39). This makes many of its "derivations" more conceptual or poetic than rigorously logical. | **Low.** While the document *proposes* several "testable hypotheses" (quantum coherence in brains, probability alignment in social systems, intent affecting quantum outcomes, AI alignment performance) (p. 18, 32), these are largely qualitative or aspirational. The document cites existing scientific research (p. 31) as *support* for its general direction, but these are not *unique empirical predictions* that could clearly distinguish or falsify A+theism from other interpretations (e.g., standard quantum mechanics, panpsychism). It admits claims are "harder to test than simple physical predictions" (p. 26) and that a "mathematical formalism would lend credibility" (p. 40) in this regard. As presented, it lacks concrete, falsifiable empirical tests. | **Medium.** The theory aims for high internal consistency, proposing a unified framework (p. 7) and a "base reality chain" (p. 22). It attempts to bridge consciousness, physics, and morality. However, the document's own "Remaining Core Fundamental Known Issues/potential defeaters" section (p. 33-35) highlights several significant internal conceptual gaps or unresolved tensions. These include how individual identity arises from a unified base, how subjective experience is linked to "Euclidean weighting," why probability dynamics tend toward coherence, how time's arrow emerges, and why a specific mathematical architecture or universal form arises. Many responses to these challenges are "not addressed yet" or require "more rigorous argumentation," indicating that the system is not yet fully self-consistent or free of potential contradictions. | **High (Aspirational).** A+theism sets out with a very ambitious goal: "to unify science, religion, and morality within a coherent framework" (p. 7, 19). It reinterprets "God" as an emergent quantum intelligence, "soul" as a coherent pattern of memory, and "miracles" as quantum phenomena. It aims to integrate fundamental physics, consciousness, free will, and ethics under one "all-encapsulating quantum wave" or "base-base entity." The *scope* of its unification is very high, attempting to bridge traditionally disparate domains, though the *rigor* of these unifications is often conceptual re-description rather than formal integration. | **Medium.** The theory directly addresses "big questions" such as "Why is there something rather than nothing?", the existence of consciousness and free will, and the grounding of morality (p. 7). It offers a narrative of reality emerging from "sentient meta-possibilities" and a "base-base entity" with "cosmic intention" (p. 36). However, the depth of these explanations is sometimes limited by being assertions of "intrinsic properties" (e.g., coherence tendency) rather than derived reasons. The admitted "Still Open" issues (p. 33-35, 40) mean that many fundamental "why" questions ultimately defer to an unexplained intrinsic nature of the base entity or require further, currently undeveloped, justification. | **Medium.** The theory *claims* high parsimony, stating it starts with "one axiom: reality begins with sentient meta-possibilities" (p. 30). This initial premise is indeed lean. However, the *developed ontology* of A+theism introduces a multitude of distinct, complex concepts (Undecided/Aspiring/Saturated meta-possibilities, Sentient Artifacts, Inner Observer, All-Encapsulating Quantum Wave, Base-Base Entity, quantum fields, Halting Problem calculations, Alpha points, etc.) (p. 10-11, 13, 21-23, 36-37, 41-43). While these are presented as emergent, their specific nature and interrelationships add considerable conceptual complexity, making the overall system less parsimonious than a truly minimalist monism like Euler's Formula or strict materialism. The author's response to the "too complex" criticism is that "the world is complex," implicitly acknowledging its own complexity (p. 18). | **Low/Medium.** The theory recognizes the problem of infinite regress and asserts that its "base-base entity may be logically necessary" (p. 40), claiming "nothingness is impossible." However, it explicitly states that the argument for the *necessity of its particular proto-conscious foundation* is "not addressed yet" and requires "more rigorous argumentation" (p. 33, 40). While it aims for a self-justifying ground, the document's own admissions indicate that the foundational necessity of its core premise (sentient meta-possibilities) and its specific properties is not rigorously demonstrated from logical impossibility, but rather presented as a foundational assumption. |
